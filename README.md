File to Clipboard
=================

A Plugin for copying a file's path or content to the 
clipboard from within the super convenient "Kupfer" command launcher.

It depends on the (pyperclip)[http://coffeeghost.net/2010/10/09/pyperclip-a-cross-platform-clipboard-module-for-python/]
python module for accessing the user's clipboard.

If you have (pip)[https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/] installed you can get the dependency
by executing:

  pip install pyperclip
