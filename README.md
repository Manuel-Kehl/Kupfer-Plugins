Kupfer Plugins
==============

A place for collecting and publishing plugins that I have written for the super convenient "Kupfer" command launcher.

File to Clipboard
-----------------

A Plugin for copying a file's path or content to the clipboard from within Kupfer.
It depends on the [pyperclip](http://coffeeghost.net/2010/10/09/pyperclip-a-cross-platform-clipboard-module-for-python/)
python module for accessing the user's clipboard.

If you have [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/) installed you can get the dependency
by executing `pip install pyperclip`.

Make new Directory
------------------

A Plugin for creating a directory within the currently selected directory.
